## Project Description
This project is a fully functional web application for advertising the renting and sale of realastate created using the MEAN stack.



The app supports role based authentication. The different roles are:
* **Users** can interract with different realastate and list their own for sale/rent. They can search all the realestate using different criteria including price price range and rent/sale. Offers can also be sent to the agency and other users for confirmation.
* **Agents** can manage all realastate in the system and list their own for sale/rent. They can also confirm/deny the different requests and see the agency statistics.
* **The Administrator**, in addition to the functionality of the agent, has a wide range of user management options, including the creation, deletion and update of both normal users and agents. The administrator can also confirm/deny new user requests.

The frontend was created using Angular. The backend is written in TypeScript. Bootstrap and Chart.js were also used. The app uses a MongoDB database.

This project was completed in the summer of 2021 as part of the Internet Application Programming course at the University Of Belgrade School of Electrical Engineering (ETF).
